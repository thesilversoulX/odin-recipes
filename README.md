# odin-recipes
A very basic website of beginner cooking recipes!

The project is a cooking recipe website which will consist of a main index page with links to a few cooking recipes. Initially, this website is going to be based on html. As I keep enriching my arsenal of developing websites, I will keep coming back to the project to keep it up to date with my forthcoming capabilities.

This could very well be an exhilarating start!
