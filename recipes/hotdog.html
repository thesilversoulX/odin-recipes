        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A hot dog, <em>also according to Wikipedia</em>, is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener or a frankfurter. The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.</p>    
        <p>Hot dogs can be made with different types of meat, and if you want to know what's in a hot dog, you just need to look at the ingredient statement. Most of the time, hot dogs are made with skeletal meat, which are trimmings of the same type of meat that makes ground meat, steaks and roasts, <em>Dr. Yancey's</em> answer to a question from <em>BestFoodFacts.org.</em></p>
