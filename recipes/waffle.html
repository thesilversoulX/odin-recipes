        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>According to Wikipedia,</em> A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used.</p>    
        <p>In the United States and Canada, waffles are a popular breakfast food, often topped with butter and maple syrup or fruit preserves. Waffles also can serve as a base for savoury mixtures such as seafood or poultry in sauce, <em>according to Britannica.</em></p>
